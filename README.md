# Neo4j Graph Data Analysis Project

## Overview
This project focuses on graph data analysis using Neo4j, a graph database management system, as documented in our final report. We utilized Neo4j to model and query our data effectively, employing its powerful graph data science library to perform complex analyses such as pathfinding, community detection, centrality measures, and link prediction.

## Data Preprocessing
For preprocessing the data, Jupyter notebooks were an integral tool, allowing us to clean and structure the data before importing it into Neo4j. This step was crucial to ensure the quality and integrity of the data for our graph models.

## Dataset
The study is based on the MyAnimeList dataset available on Kaggle: [MyAnimeList Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/patmendoza/myanimelist-api?resource=download).

## Collaboration
The project was a collaborative effort by a team of four, utilizing both Neo4j for the graph database management and analysis, and Jupyter for the data preprocessing stages.

## Final Presentation
A presentation of our findings and methodologies was conducted, emphasizing the analytical process and the insights derived from the application of graph data science.
